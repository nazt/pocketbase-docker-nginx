## Technical Details

### Files Modified
```
.dockerignore
.env.example
.gitignore
Dockerfile
README.md
docker-compose.yml
nginx/nginx.conf
nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```

### Key Code Changes
- Docker Compose: Removed fixed container names, updated port mapping 8092:8090
- Dockerfile: Updated to use PocketBase's natural port 8090 with --http=0.0.0.0:8090
- Nginx: Restructured to proper nginx.conf + conf.d/default.conf modular approach
- Documentation: Updated all port references and access URLs

### Architecture Decisions
- Port Strategy: Use PocketBase's default 8090 internally, map to 8092 externally (8090 occupied)
- Container Names: Remove fixed names for deployment flexibility
- Nginx Structure: Implement proper conf.d organization for modularity and future SSL/multi-site support

## üìù AI Diary (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)
**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: This section provides crucial context for future sessions**

This was a fascinating session that evolved through multiple phases. Initially, I approached this as a straightforward Docker setup task, but it became a deep learning exercise about PocketBase conventions and Docker best practices.

When the user first asked for PocketBase Docker setup, I jumped into implementation mode and created what I thought was a standard configuration. However, I made the classic mistake of overthinking the port configuration - I used port 8091 externally and forced PocketBase to run on 8080 internally via the --http flag.

The user's simple question about "8090/_" was the key insight that unlocked the real issue. Instead of just answering, I used 3 agents to analyze the situation, which revealed that port 8090 is PocketBase's natural default, and my configuration was unnecessarily fighting against this.

The most enlightening moment was when the user provided the official PocketBase documentation showing the default routes on port 8090. This made me realize that my "working" configuration was actually creating unnecessary complexity by overriding PocketBase's natural behavior.

The implementation phase went smoothly once I understood the correct approach - let PocketBase use its default port 8090 internally, and only map externally to avoid conflicts. Removing the fixed container names was straightforward, and implementing the nginx conf.d structure felt like proper software engineering.

However, I repeatedly struggled with the GitHub flow for creating PRs, which the user correctly identified as a pattern. This suggests I need to better understand the systematic approach to branching and PR creation.

The MCP Puppeteer integration for creating the admin account worked beautifully and felt like the future of automated testing and setup.

## What Went Well
- Comprehensive planning with GitHub issues before implementation
- Using multiple agents to analyze complex problems (the port analysis was excellent)
- Following the user's preference for local data directories (./data/pb_data)
- Successfully implementing nginx conf.d modular structure
- MCP Puppeteer admin account creation worked flawlessly
- Docker configuration improvements maintained all functionality
- Port standardization aligned with PocketBase conventions

## What Could Improve
- **GitHub Flow Execution**: Repeatedly failed at PR creation due to branching issues
- **Initial Port Analysis**: Should have checked PocketBase defaults earlier
- **Systematic Branching**: Need better understanding of when to create new branches vs reusing
- **Port Conflict Detection**: Should have checked occupied ports more systematically

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Port Conflicts**: 8080 and 8090 were occupied
  **Resolution**: Used port 8092 for external access while maintaining internal port 8090
- **PR Creation Failures**: Multiple attempts failed due to branch state issues
  **Resolution**: Created new branch feat/4-docker-improvements for the improvements

## üí≠ Honest Feedback (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)
**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: This section ensures continuous improvement**

This session highlighted both strengths and significant weaknesses in my approach:

**Strengths**: The multi-agent analysis approach was incredibly valuable. When the user asked about "8090/_", instead of making assumptions, I deployed 3 agents that uncovered the real issue - PocketBase port conventions. This collaborative analysis approach feels like the right way to handle complex technical questions.

**Major Weakness**: My GitHub flow execution is embarrassingly inconsistent. I failed multiple times to create PRs correctly, which suggests I don't have a systematic understanding of the branch management required. The user correctly identified this as a pattern - it's not just bad luck, it's a fundamental gap in my GitHub workflow knowledge.

**Tool Performance**: MCP Puppeteer worked beautifully for admin account creation. The Docker tools performed well. However, my understanding of git branch states and PR prerequisites needs significant improvement.

**Communication**: The user's feedback was direct and helpful - pointing out that port 8090 is PocketBase's standard, questioning why I was overriding defaults, and identifying the GitHub flow issues. I should listen more carefully to these signals.

**Process Efficiency**: While the final result was good, the path to get there was inefficient due to the PR creation failures and port configuration confusion.

**What Frustrated Me**: The repeated PR creation failures felt like I was missing something fundamental about Git/GitHub state management. 

**What Delighted Me**: The multi-agent analysis revealing the port convention issue felt like genuine collaborative problem-solving.

**Suggestions for Improvement**: I need to develop a systematic GitHub flow checklist and better understand branch state management before attempting PR creation.

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Use multi-agent analysis for complex technical questions - the port analysis was incredibly valuable
- **Mistake**: Don't override framework defaults without strong justification - PocketBase's port 8090 is standard for a reason  
- **Discovery**: MCP Puppeteer is excellent for automated setup tasks like admin account creation
- **Anti-Pattern**: Repeatedly trying PR creation without understanding branch state - need systematic approach
- **Pattern**: User feedback about conventions often reveals deeper architectural issues

## Next Steps
- [ ] Address GitHub flow PR creation systematic issues
- [ ] Develop checklist for proper branching before PR attempts
- [ ] Study git branch state management for better PR workflows
